👉 Source code to implement the basic operations of a singly linked list (insertion, deletion, and traversal) from the file : [src.c](https://github.com/DeviprasadShetty9833/Stack.c/blob/3b59308a1191ee4e4cc662b8bfdc20ecb9c7c3bf/src/Stack_using_Array.c)

📂 Stack Using Array

<table>  
<tr><td>  
  ⏺️ A stack is a linear data structure that follows the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle.

You can push (insert) elements onto the top of the stack.

You can pop (remove) elements from the top of the stack.

You can also peek (view) the top element without removing it.


The stack has a maximum size, and operations must check for overflow (too many elements) and underflow (trying to pop from an empty stack).

<details>  
  <summary>Click to expand 🔻</summary>  <br> 🟠 Basic Operations:

Push (insert an element)

Pop (remove an element)

Peek/Top (get top element without removing)

Display (print all elements in stack order)


<br> 🟠 Applications:

Expression evaluation (postfix/prefix).

Undo/Redo in editors.

Function call management in recursion.

Browser forward/backward navigation.


<br> 🟠 Advantages:

Easy to implement with arrays or linked lists.

Ensures controlled access order.

👉 Source Code (file: stack_array.c)

1. Headers

#include <stdio.h>   // For printf and scanf  
#include <stdlib.h>  // For exit()

In Plain English:

> "These are my toolkits. stdio.h helps me talk to you (input/output), and stdlib.h helps me quit when things go wrong."




---

2. Define Stack

#define MAX 5   // Maximum size of the stack

typedef struct {
    int arr[MAX];   // Array to hold stack elements
    int top;        // Index of the top element
} Stack;

Explanation:

MAX defines the stack’s capacity.

arr[MAX] is the container holding stack elements.

top keeps track of where the top element is (starts at -1 when empty).


In Plain English:

> "Think of me as a stack of plates. arr is the plate rack, and top tells me which plate is on the very top. Initially, top = -1, meaning the rack is empty."




---

3. Initialize Stack

void initStack(Stack *s) {
    s->top = -1;   // Empty stack
}

Algorithm:

1. Set s->top = -1.



In Plain English:

> "I reset the rack so it’s empty. No plates here yet."




---

4. Push Operation

void push(Stack *s, int data) {
    if (s->top == MAX - 1) {
        printf("Stack Overflow! Cannot push %d\n", data);
        return;
    }
    s->arr[++(s->top)] = data;
    printf("%d pushed into stack\n", data);
}

Algorithm:

1. Check if stack is full → if yes, print “Overflow”.


2. Increment top.


3. Place data at arr[top].



Example:

Before push: top = -1

Push 10 → arr[0] = 10, top = 0

Push 20 → arr[1] = 20, top = 1


Stack: [10, 20] (20 is on top)

In Plain English:

> "I check if the rack is full. If not, I place your plate on the top and move the marker up. Voilà — plate stacked!"




---

5. Pop Operation

int pop(Stack *s) {
    if (s->top == -1) {
        printf("Stack Underflow! Nothing to pop\n");
        return -1;
    }
    return s->arr[(s->top)--];
}

Algorithm:

1. Check if stack is empty → if yes, underflow.


2. Return arr[top].


3. Decrement top.



Example:

Stack: [10, 20, 30] (top = 2)

Pop → returns 30, new top = 1


Stack: [10, 20]

In Plain English:

> "I look at the top plate, hand it back to you, and then move the marker down. One less plate in the stack!"




---

6. Peek Operation

int peek(Stack *s) {
    if (s->top == -1) {
        printf("Stack is empty!\n");
        return -1;
    }
    return s->arr[s->top];
}

In Plain English:

> "I won’t touch the stack, but I’ll tell you which plate is on top right now."




---

7. Display Stack

void display(Stack *s) {
    if (s->top == -1) {
        printf("Stack is empty!\n");
        return;
    }
    printf("Stack elements (top to bottom):\n");
    for (int i = s->top; i >= 0; i--)
        printf("%d\n", s->arr[i]);
}

Example:
If stack = [10, 20, 30], output is:

30
20
10

In Plain English:

> "I’ll show you all plates starting from the top. Like tipping the stack for a peek."




---

8. Main Function

int main() {
    Stack s;
    initStack(&s);

    push(&s, 10);
    push(&s, 20);
    push(&s, 30);
    display(&s);

    printf("Top element: %d\n", peek(&s));

    printf("Popped: %d\n", pop(&s));
    display(&s);

    return 0;
}

Sample Output:

10 pushed into stack
20 pushed into stack
30 pushed into stack
Stack elements (top to bottom):
30
20
10
Top element: 30
Popped: 30
Stack elements (top to bottom):
20
10
